## Dependency Management

This project uses `npm-check-updates` to manage dependencies.

- To check for outdated dependencies, run:

  ```bash
  npm run deps:check
  ```

- To update the dependencies in `package.json`, run:

  ```bash
  npm run deps:update
  ```

After updating, run `npm install` to install the new versions.

## 🎨 Overview

**Tokyo Night Modern** is not just another dark theme. It's a declaratively generated, minimalist theme focused on balance and consistency.

- **Declarative by Design**: The entire theme is generated from a central palette (`src/theme/palette.ts`). No more manual JSON tweaks.
- **Code-First**: All colors and tokens are managed through TypeScript, ensuring type safety and maintainability.
- **Strictly Tested**: Automated validation and identity tests guarantee that the theme remains consistent and error-free after every change.
- **Zero Hardcoded Colors**: Every color is based on a role or token, making the theme predictable and easy to customize.
